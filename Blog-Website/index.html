              React Fiber is a complete rewrite of the React core, which is
              designed to improve the overall performance of React applications.
              In this article, we will take a deep dive into React Fiber and
              understand how it works under the hood.

                  React Fiber introduces a new reconciliation algorithm that
                  allows React to pause and resume the rendering process.

                  React Fiber is still in development and is not yet stable for

              The Year 2038 problem is a computer science issue that is related
              to the representation of time in computer systems. In this
              article, we will explore the Year 2038 problem and understand why
              it is a ticking time bomb for computers.

                  The Year 2038 problem is related to the representation of time
                  in computer systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is caused by the use of a 32-bit signed integer to
                  represent time in seconds since the Unix epoch.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Year 2038 problem will occur on January 19, 2038, when the
                  32-bit signed integer overflows and resets to a negative
                  value.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Year 2038 problem can be mitigated by using a 64-bit
                  signed integer to represent time or by using alternative time
                  representations.
