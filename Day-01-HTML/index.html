            React Fiber is a complete rewrite of the React core, which is
            designed to improve the overall performance of React applications.
            In this article, we will take a deep dive into React Fiber and
            understand how it works under the hood.

              React Fiber introduces a new reconciliation algorithm that allows
              React to pause and resume the rendering process.

              React Fiber is still in development and is not yet stable for
              production use.

          <h2>The Year 2038 Problem: A Ticking Time Bomb for Computers</h2>

          <p>
            The Year 2038 problem is a computer science issue that is related to
            the representation of time in computer systems. In this article, we
            will explore the Year 2038 problem and understand why it is a
            ticking time bomb for computers.
          </p>
          <h2>Key Points:</h2>

              The Year 2038 problem is related to the representation of time in
              computer systems.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is caused by the use of a 32-bit signed integer to represent
              time in seconds since the Unix epoch.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Year 2038 problem will occur on January 19, 2038, when the
              32-bit signed integer overflows and resets to a negative value.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Year 2038 problem can be mitigated by using a 64-bit signed
              integer to represent time or by using alternative time
              representations.
